        <div class="text__col--basic">
          <img src="../img/david-middleton-portrait.jpg" alt="David Middleton">
          <p>This is my twelfth newsletter in a series of forty, or thereabouts, and this year perhaps more than ever, I have found myself looking back at the journey so far and wondering about the future possibilities. This has been a cathartic, momentous and thought-provoking exercise for me.  Trying to capture all the significant happenings of the past year has required some discipline as 2017 has produced many firsts for</p>
          <p>Mount Mary and as always, I want to inform and enthuse you but of course not burden you with TMI (Too Much Information).</p>
          <p>So, what is so significant about 2017?</p>
          <p>At Mount Mary, family comes first, and on 18 January 2017, Victoria and myself, with some “assistance” from Georgina and Sam, welcomed our first grandchild, Henry Samuel Middleton into the world. Here’s a picture of the delightful newest Middleton family member and maybe, with a bit of coaxing, a fourth-generation wine-grower at Mount Mary!</p>
          <p>A significant milestone is also achieved this year as it marks our 40th annual wine release here at Mount Mary. Now I know every year I say the wines are good, and I believe they are, however the team and I feel that the 2015 wines are simply stunning, and indeed some may well prove to be the standouts of the Mount Mary journey so far. But you be the judge of these outrageous claims of mine!</p>
          <img src="../img/first-grandchild.jpg" alt="First grandchild">
          <p>To commemorate our 40th annual wine release at Mount Mary, in the coming pages I’ll share with you memorable highlights from each decade. Quite a challenging task I might add given the many memories, climatic events, family milestones, winemaking methodologies and techniques that have occurred over the years. Hopefully it gives you a snapshot of life at Mount Mary through the decades since our first release in 1976. We are very proud of our persistence as a family business, in the same way as we are proud of the longevity of the wines we produce.</p>
          <p>The 2015 vintage also marks a new wine at Mount Mary.</p>
          <p class="pullquote">It’s the first year we have bottled a straight Cabernet made entirely from our oldest 1971 plantings, with a very limited quantity of just 650 bottles produced.</p>
          <p>This wine will only be produced in the very best vintages, which 2015 most definitely was. We believe this Cabernet proves how suited this variety is to the Yarra Valley region and highlights our continuing focus on producing world-class premium wines.  Left to age for a further 12 months, this Cabernet will be released in October 2018 alongside the release of our 2016 wines.</p>
          <p>The firsts continue this year as we have established a block of close planted Pinot in our north-western corner and launched our first new label, Marli Russell by Mount Mary, on Sunday, 23 April 2017 at a beautiful picnic setting on the front lawn overlooking the vineyard.</p>
          <p>Closer to release, we’ll also hold our first Members and Mailing List tasting in Sydney for our 2015 wines.  If you are in NSW and interested in attending, email admin@mountmary.com.au and we will send you a priority invite with all of the details.  I’m sure it will be a tremendous event and we are very much looking forward to it.</p>
          <p>Finally, and perhaps the most significant first for us, one that we are very proud of, is to have been awarded Winery of the Year at the annual Halliday Wine Companion Awards on 2 August, 2017.  Read over the page for my reflection on what this means to us.</p>

        <div class="text__col--basic">
          <img class="winery-award" src="../img/award-winner-roundel-winery-2018.jpg" alt="Winery of the Year award">
          <p>The Halliday Wine Companion Awards are held annually. For us, the Winery of the Year Award acknowledges many years of hard work as we have continued to dedicate ourselves to producing world-class wines and striving for excellence in everything that we do.</p>
          <p class="pullquote">To receive this commendation from such a renowned and well respected wine expert as James Halliday, means a lot to us and gives us great confidence for the future.</p>
          <p>To me, this award is a welcome comfort after many years of all sorts of difficulties in the wake of my father John Middleton’s death.</p>
          <p>There were times when it seemed too hard and the problems too big to overcome. At Mount Mary, we have always tried to do the right thing by our customers, clients, the industry generally and of course our community. We’ve also placed great emphasis on the quality of our product and this is one thing we’ll never compromise on.</p>
          <p>At the awards event, James Halliday expressed his thoughts on why he decided to recognise Mount Mary in this way. The key reasons were our history, family continuity, consistency, our future vision and the creation of our Marli Russell white and red wines made from seven varieties we began planting in 2008. These varieties are traditionally grown in the Rhone Valley of France and our vision in planting these vines was to continue to explore the potential of our unique site, creating some new and exciting wines.  All our new plantings  since 2007 have been on phylloxera resistant rootstocks, a strategy which is slowly building our insurance against the inevitable arrival of this debilitating disease.</p>
          <p>At the Halliday Wine Companion Awards, we were also honoured to receive the award for best Pinot noir with our 2015 Mount Mary Vineyard Pinot noir. This is a great testament to not only our Mount Mary site, but also the Yarra Valley region’s favourable conditions, enabling world-class Pinot’s to be produced. </p>
          <p>My father (who would have been 93 this year) was never one for awards of any kind. Unless of course, he was the recipient! He would have been beaming with pride if he’d been alive to enjoy this moment in our journey. He always held a long-term view of doing something special.</p>
          <p>He truly believed from the outset that he could produce world-class wine and he proved it by doing just that. Whilst he did receive considerable recognition in his own lifetime as a producer of fine wine, I don’t think he would have expected that we would have such a consistent and long journey ahead of us. The family and I are now thinking in a similar way he would have back then and we are all truly excited about the future.</p>
          <p>There have been many team members both past and present that have enabled us to earn this kind of accolade. It’s great recognition of their dedication to building on my father’s legacy while also showing great leadership to adapt and change in this ever-evolving industry. No doubt I should be acknowledging every member of our team past and present individually, however a select few deserve to be singled out: </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Sam Middleton</strong>, Head Winemaker, has a drive and enthusiasm to always do better and having been exposed to this industry at such a young age and having the benefit of shadowing his grandfather John over many years, Sam’s passion for producing premium table wines is stronger than ever.</li>
            <li><strong>Claire Podsiadly</strong> (nee Middleton), Business Manager, has shown exceptional faith in Mount Mary having left a very successful career five years ago to be involved and further shape the future of Mount Mary.</li>
            <li><strong>Hugh Middleton</strong> who with his grasp of technology and knowledge of our processes, has built and maintained our ability to operate in this new world of electronic communication, data management and web based systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Mario Marson</strong> who began his wine-making career with us and has since been involved in many other successful ventures. Mario remains a long-term colleague and much loved friend of the family.</li>
            <li><strong>Rob Hall</strong> worked with us through the decade 2000-2010 and helped see us through some difficult and challenging times including the death of John in 2006. Rob continues to excel in the industry and has recently established his own label.</li>
            <li><strong>Victoria Middleton</strong> who has worked behind the scenes to nurture and sustain the family in their work at Mount Mary. This is not to mention all these years of feeding the workforce during the busy times, harvest and release.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Above all else we would like to thank you, our loyal customers’, who have shared the ride with us since the beginning and without your continued support, we wouldn’t be here doing what we love.</p>

          <p>On Sunday, 23 April 2017, the inaugural Marli Russell picnic took place on what was a stunning autumn’s day at Mount Mary to mark the release of our first wines under this label. With over 150 people relaxing on the grass, snacking on a Yarra Valley Dairy cheese platter while tasting Marli Russell new release wines, it really couldn’t have been more perfect.  It was lovely to hear our Mailing List and Members’ kind feedback on the day and we have enjoyed the positive response the wines have received from our customers. We are already looking forward to next year’s picnic and the release of the 2016 Marli Russell wines.</p>
          <img src="../img/marli-russell-picnic.jpg" alt="Marli Russell Picnic">
          <p>Marli Middleton (nee Russell), co-founder of Mount Mary, was the inspiration behind the label in recognition of her enthusiasm for our family to continue the pursuit of new ideas. Marli was an inspiring, adventurous and fun-loving woman and it’s this spirit of hers that we hope shines through in these wines.</p>

        <h2 class="text__heading section-headings">Climatic weather trends</h2>
        <div class="text__col--basic">
          <p>For some years now, in fact since 2010, we’ve had a graph on display in the winery which quite clearly shows the trending warm in the Yarra Valley. This graph has always been of interest to visitors and we’ve promised on many occasions to update the graphic. As you can see, vintages are now beginning a full month earlier than when Mount Mary first started back in the mid 1970’s. It’s also our opinion, unsubstantiated as yet, that vintages are more condensed than they used to be. Of course, we were aware of the issue of climate change many years ago and we have devoted space to the topic in past newsletters.</p>
          <p>There are a couple of interesting trends that come out of these summaries. The first is that the suspected warming of our harvest seasons, calculated by taking the daily maximums over January, February and March and averaging them over the three months leading up to harvest, is supported by the evidence. The second and perhaps even more interesting finding is that the minimum temperatures, calculated in the same way, show a steady decrease. This could be interpreted as the days becoming warmer and the nights cooler! This could also explain why we have still been able to produce wines with good flavour development in the hotter years. The Chardonnay harvest dates show a steady and obvious trend to earlier ripening. This amounts to a 30 day advance since 1976.</p>
          <p>The rainfall data is also quite enlightening. We have taken the rainfall for the four months leading up to harvest as an indicator of how ‘wet’ or ‘dry’ the vintage was. These figures show no trending of seasonal rainfall or indeed annual rainfall. There is much variation from year-to-year but neither drying nor moistening trends. For those that share my interest in this sort of stuff, I am preparing more detailed graphs and analyses for display over our release weekends.</p>

          <h2 class="section-headings section-headings--graphs">Rootstock plantings, By Sam Middleton, head winemaker</h2>
          <img src="../img/sam-profile.jpg" alt="Sam Middleton">
          <p>When our vineyard expanded out to the west of the original plantings it was decided that a new Merlot block was required.  John Middleton, my grandfather and founder of Mount Mary, would often remark that ‘due to the complacent attitude from the larger wine producers in the Yarra, one day sooner rather than later, our valley will be infected with the horrible vine aphid known as Phylloxera’.  And, so our first rootstock block was planted in Spring 2003.  This was three years before the first signs of Phylloxera were detected in the Yarra.  Interestingly, some 11 years on from the first Phylloxera findings and 14 years since our first rootstock plantings, there is still a large number of Yarra Valley wine growers that are yet to plant on rootstock.  Due in part to luck, the rootstock chosen for this block has been a huge success and is now considered our best block of Merlot. </p>
          <p class="pullquote">There are a vast number of considerations to make when choosing a particular rootstock to plant.</p>
          <p>Soil composition and environmental conditions are extremely important to consider.  Some rootstocks are very drought tolerant, while others require substantially more soil moisture to thrive. </p>
          <p>Some grow dense canopies and large berries, while others are less vigorous and grow smaller, tighter bunches.  Some have a higher tolerance to salty soils and nematodes, while others should not be used on particular sites due to their inability to grow under these conditions.</p>
          <p>Some rootstocks seem to help the fruit to retain natural acid during ripening,  while others tend to promote higher juice pH levels at harvest time.  Some tend to ripen the fruit more quickly than that of own rooted vines, while others are seen to delay ripening.</p>
          <p>There are some rootstocks that seem to perform better when grafted to certain varieties and clones than they do with others.</p>
          <p>All of this and much more needs to be carefully considered by the winemaker and viticulturist before planting can begin.</p>
          <p>We firmly believe that in order to find the most well suited rootstock to our vineyard site we must trial a number of different rootstocks that we feel can produce the grape quality and consistency we are striving for.</p>
          <p>Here at Mount Mary we have chosen to trial rootstocks that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>are drought tolerant to support changing environmental conditions combined with the fact our vineyard is not irrigated</li>
            <li>promote small, tight bunches which is always desirable for premium wine production</li>
            <li>help to maintain natural acid during the ripening process as well as retain freshness in the warmer/drier years.</li>
            <li>After nine years of assessing the way certain varieties grow on a range of different rootstocks, we are getting closer to defining what the ideal rootstock is for our purposes here at Mount Mary.</li>

          <p class="pullquote">2015 will quite simply be remembered as one of the greatest vintages we have ever seen here at Mount Mary.</p>
          <p>Exceptional ripening conditions throughout the growing season in 2015 have contributed to vibrant, expressive, complex, perfectly balanced and long lived wines, which already show tremendous purity of fruit.</p>
          <p>We believe that together, the 2015 suite of wines are the perfect example (stylistically) of what we are constantly striving to emulate here at Mount Mary, with only the seasonal variation occasionally skewing our ideals.</p>
          <p>We are extremely excited to finally be sharing these wines with you and hope you enjoy them as much as we think you will!</p>

          <p>2015 Quintet</p>
          <p>We believe the 2015 Quintet aromas reflect exactly what these Cabernet varieties should from a cool climate region in the very best vintages.  Although slightly lower in Cabernet Sauvignon percentage than both the 2013 and 2014 wines, there is still a distinctive, perfectly ripe Cabernet element to the aroma.  The flavour profile of this wine is perhaps showing slightly darker fruits than what is typically seen in our Quintet blend on release.  Cassis, spice, blackberries and liquorice are all easily detectable along with the more customary aromas of cherries and earth often seen in this blend.  The palate is vibrant and concentrated, showing an impressive balance and togetherness already.  There’s a densely-packed grip of tannin suggesting this wine will age gracefully in the cellar for many years to come.</p>

          <p>2015 Pinot noir</p>
          <p>Time will dictate where this vintage of Pinot noir sits in relation to other great vintages, however we cannot remember a vintage that excited us more on release.  The aroma of this wine constantly evolves in the glass.  Initially there are hints of plums, quince and raspberries.  These primary fruit aspects are balanced beautifully by spice, dried roses and truffle, adding layers of complexity and interest. The flavour intensity on the palate is backed by fine grain tannin, giving this wine some savoury complexities.  This tannin is also contributing to the drive and length of the wine through the palate, adding length to the finish.</p>

          <p>2015 Chardonnay</p>
          <p>2015 was an ideal season for producing quintessential Mount Mary Chardonnay.  Philosophically, we strive to make Chardonnay that sits somewhere between the old and new world styles.  Firm fresh acid, backed by healthy amounts of flavour, body and character are evident in this wine, attributed from site and season.  The aromas of the 2015 Chardonnay open with a slight whiff of struck match before showing an aroma profile ranging from grapefruit and lime right through to white peach, honey, toast, nuts and an array of spices.  The palate shows restraint and poise whilst displaying an incredible underlying power and intensity. It’s the purity and length of this wine that sets it apart from other vintages.</p>

          <p>The 2015 Triolet opens with some reductive notes which quickly dissipate within the first couple of swirls to reveal an incredibly complex bouquet.  This wine seems so well stitched together, even at this early stage, making it hard to detect each individual variety within the blend.  Citrus, lime and hints of passionfruit are initially detected. With time in the glass, the floral components of this wine take charge which we generally attribute to the Muscadelle component.  There is a strict acid/phenolic structure giving this 2015 Triolet incredible drive and a greater depth of flavour than is typical for this wine on release.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="text__col--2">
          <p>The 2017 vintage was quite a contrast to what we experienced in 2016. Whilst 2016 will be remembered as one of the shortest, most compressed vintages on record (90% of our fruit was harvested in two and a half weeks!), 2017 was a much more drawn out affair. </p>
          <p>Harvest began on 25 February, two weeks after the start of the 2016 harvest, and concluded in April (with the Grenache being our final pick on 7 April). The mild temperatures experienced throughout the growing season, combined with a few untimely rain events, meant that ripening progression throughout 2017 was slow.  Picking decisions can be challenging for these vintages as more emphasis must be placed on tasting rather than chemical analysis to determine the ideal time of harvest.</p>
          <p>The benefit on the other hand, of slower ripening during harvest, is that it allows more time to be spent on vinification based decisions. Early signs are that 2017 will be remembered as an exceptional vintage for Chardonnay and Pinot noir and a well above average vintage for the Cabernet varieties.</p>
          <p>As is always the case here at Mount Mary, we will remain patient as we watch the progression of these wines in barrel over the next 12-18 months.</p>
